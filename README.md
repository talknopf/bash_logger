#BASH toolkit v1.0
for those time you simply have to work with bash but you want you script to be top notch!
this tool is basically a collection of smaller tools i gathered over time some wrote by me, some i just improved or adapted.

# bash_logger
This wrapper will allow you to display colorful logging along with actual logfile to be generated by your scripts
tha basics of using the logs are:
```
info "info message text"

warn "warn message text"

error "error message text"

exit_on_error "error message text" "<exit code>"
```

# Command line parsing and validation:
up until now you had to either used numbered arguments `./script.sh $1 $2 $3 ...` or somtimes `./script.sh $@ `

<h1>To parse the arguments:</h1> 
all you need to do is call upon 'parse args' function along with input array and parsing will be done.
```
parse_args $@
```

so to give a more practical example:
```
./script.sh -arg1 "foo" -arg2 "bar"
```

and within the script you will have the following variables:
```
ARG1='foo'
ARG2='bar'
```

<h1>To validate the arguments and variables:</h1>
when before you needed to validate in such manner: `[[ $VAR1 ]] || exit 1`

now you can validate by using the validate_args "VAR1" "VAR2"
if the variable is not defined you will recieve an elborate error on it being missing

# Installation
just clone the repo to the location of your choosing

# Testing the installation
running the built-in test script will show you and example of the functions mentioned above.
this script will exit with an error, it should be doing that.
```
./bash_tools_tester.sh -t foo -r bar
```

# How to use?
source /path/to/folder/bash_toolkit.sh
from this point on you can simply call upon the functions
